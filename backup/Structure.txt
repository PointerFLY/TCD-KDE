Notes: 
1. Terms with first letter capitalized are classes, lowercase terms are properties. For example, School is a Class, BoySchool is a class, address is a property. Ethoc, Catholic, ChurchOfIreland, MultiDenominational are special Classes, ruled by oneOf.
2. ObjectProperties are explained with : xxx, other properties are literal (integer, string, etc).
3. I will create instance only for School and County Classes, other classes are defined for creating ObjectProperties.
4. In general, we have 11 Classes and 16 properties. (RDFS:label is not defined by us, so does not count)
